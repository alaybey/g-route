# Modular Route Handling For Golang

This is a simple example of a Go web application demonstrating modular route handling using the net/http with golang 1.22+

## Overview

This project illustrates how to organize a Go web application with multiple controllers, each responsible for handling specific routes. The goal is to keep the codebase clean, modular, and easy to maintain.

## Features

- **Modular Route Handling:** Controllers are organized into separate files, making it easy to manage routes for different parts of the application.
- **Centralized Route Definition:** Routes are defined in a central location (routes.go), where controllers register themselves with the router.
- **Controller Interface:** All controllers implement a BaseController interface, ensuring consistency and structure across the application.
## Structure 
        .
        ├── controllers
        │ ├── BaseController.go
        │ └── *Controller.go # OtherControllers
        ├── main.go

## Advantages
Less Code Complexity !

#### Monolithic/Modular Monolothic Architecture with Modular Route Handling
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Organizing routes into separate modules makes it easier to manage and maintain the codebase.
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Can scale individual modules independently, allowing for better resource allocation and improved performance.
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Developers can work on specific modules without needing to understand the entire application, reducing cognitive load and improving productivity.
- **Flexibility**: Modules can be added, updated, or removed with minimal impact on other parts of the application, providing flexibility for future enhancements.

#### Microservices Architecture with Modular Route Handling
- **Isolation of Concerns**: Each microservice can have its own set of routes, encapsulating related functionality and promoting separation of concerns.
- **Independent Deployment**: Routes and associated handlers/controllers can be deployed independently as part of their respective microservices, enabling rapid iteration and deployment.
- **Scalability**: Can scale individual microservices and their associated routes independently based on demand, providing efficient resource utilization and improved performance.
- **Technology Flexibility**: Allows for the use of different technologies and frameworks for each microservice's routes, optimizing for specific requirements and preferences.
- **Granular Monitoring and Debugging**: Modular route handling facilitates granular monitoring and debugging of individual microservices, aiding in performance optimization and issue resolution.
